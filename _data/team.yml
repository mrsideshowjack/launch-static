    bio: Sally Thompson had the vision for developing Launch International as a pioneering organisation that "gets things off the ground" for businesses through an innovative new software platform which brings together connections, information and solutions, supported by key partners, specialists and networks. The Company will be known as 'Launch' and the aim is to enable business to do more business in the UK and internationally. <br/><br/>Prior to establishing Launch, Sally was the founding Chief Executive of Business South since its inception in 2006 and led the organisation for eleven years. She launched the 'Champion Programme' with the purpose of uniting business leaders across all sectors to sell and promote the region and to champion the economy. The Champion network engaged over 250 leading employers with a collective turnover of more than £4bn, employing over 100,000 staff. Through Business South, Champions make things happen for the greater economic good by creating the business case and evidence base, whilst driving positive change and increased economic outcomes, through their significant, collective influence - such as in the commissioning and development of the Master Plan for Southampton which has brought over £3bn investment to the City. Business South became the premier business engagement organisation in the region. <br/><br/>Previously Sally facilitated the development of the Cowes Marine Cluster with a supply chain of over 100 companies. She has a track record of achievement throughout her career,  including winning the Shell Livewire Award for the Isle of Wight as a young entrepreneur and the inaugural Wessex Woman of the Year Award in 2002.
